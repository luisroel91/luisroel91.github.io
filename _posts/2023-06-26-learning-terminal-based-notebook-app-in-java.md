Recently, I've decided to go back to school and get my degree. Even after 7 years in the industry, its something I've always wanted to do and as Shia once famously said, "don't let your dreams be dreams".

It seems that an inevitable part of this journey is learning Java. Something which I have not been looking particularly forward to...However, (surprise heh) I've found that the language isn't bad as everyone says.

The final assignment in my "Into to Java" course was to create a program to solve a basic, but "real world" problem. To that end I created a simple terminal based note taking program [here](https://replit.com/@LuisRoel1/Java-TouchStone-NotebookApp). 

Of course, writing a simple note-taking app isn't enough to understand the nuances of a language. Its strenghts and weaknesses.

In my limited experience in Java, however, here are the things I've learned/noticed:

1. There doesn't seem to be the concept of default parameters in Java...this is a bit odd to me and caused me to have to overload the constructor to get something similar to default parameters.
2. The way that imports work is they belong to packages. Packages are declared at the top of files and must reside within the same folder, named the same as the package, in order to be able to import your classes into other files.
3. This is my opinion, but it is exceptionally verbose. I feel like I have to type a lot more to get the same amount of work done.
4. Just like in other languages, I don't like the idea of an implicit "this", but IDE tooling makes this a non-issue.
5. Its cool that the JDBC exists, its nice to have a singular interface for using so many different and seemingly disjointed databases.
6. Its interesting to see conventions in this language that are also used in others, as a consequence of legacy.

Overall, I think if you have experience with other languages, Java will be very easy to pick up. I do reccomend learning it. The reason as to "why" they do things in other languages the way they do becomes a little clearer after learning some Java.

Be excellent to each other,
